# FBLA_coding-programming2021

This repository is for my FBLA coding and programming competition project for the 2020-2021 school year. The topic of the program was to be able to randomly generate 5 question FBLA quizzes and store the information persistently. The program utilized Tkinter to code the GUI and sqlite3 to manage the relational database. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

* Download this repository as a zip file
* Open the whole folder ('FBLA_coding-programming2021-master') as a project in your preferred IDE
* Open the 'main.py'
* Uncomment lines 19-86
* Then run the program for the first time
* After running the program once comment lines 19-86 so that you do not enter the data into the database twice or create a second questions table

### Prerequisites

Tkinter and sqlite3 are a part of the Python standard library and come with Python 3.x when it is downloaded.

## Built With

* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#tkinter-modules) - The GUI module used
* [SQLite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) - Relational database management system module used
